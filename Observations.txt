- we will use that subset of data as test set which has salary as -1 initially since that is substantial no. of records
- we noticed we mostly have skewed data so maybe we can apply minmax scaling
- we can even try later during modelling which scaler gives us better accuracy


# also i am thinking to fit an ANN and see accuracy of predictions rather than just simply using basic ML models - but we found it's not feasable for our use case when we have very less data

# also we can try fitting a lasso regression to do feature selection automatically to improve accuracy - we did try but no improvement 
# we also used pca but the model metrics did not improve

Note that from the distplot of our avg_salary column , we can see that the data is right skewed and there are outliers there..

We can think of shifting our focus from salary prediction to classification into a job_title according to the skills and salary field or any other field maybe !
Also we can think of applying clustering techniques to see clusters in our data based on skills and salary and job title ! - did this step in the encodings part 2 ipynb

Movie recommender system m jo bhi humare text columns the vo humne saare words sbhi columns k ek sath hi encode kr diye using bag of words on all the columns combined. - becoz in that we collectively made a column telling every thing about the movie.. - hume vectors bnane the to get cosine similarity between them
