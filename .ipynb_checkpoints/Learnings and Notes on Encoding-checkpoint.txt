Comparison
Encoding Type	Data Type	Usage	Purpose
Frequency	Categorical	Replace category with its frequency/count	Compress high-cardinality columns, useful for tree models
Target	Categorical	Replace category with the mean (or statistic) of the target	Capture the relationship between category and target
Bag of Words	Text	Convert text into numerical vectors of word counts	For text data, especially NLP tasks


Frequency Encoding
What it is: In frequency encoding, each category in a column is replaced by the frequency (or count) of that category in the dataset.
Why it's used: It provides numerical values for categorical data without creating many new columns (as one-hot encoding does). It's particularly helpful for high-cardinality data (columns with many unique categories).
Example:
If the "Type" column contains:

Type: [Private, Public, Private, Private, Public, Government]
Frequency encoding will replace it as:

Private → 3
Public → 2
Government → 1

When to Use:
When the frequency of a category is meaningful for prediction (e.g., company popularity, product demand).
Suitable for tree-based models like Random Forest or XGBoost.


Target Encoding
What it is: In target encoding, each category in a column is replaced by the mean (or other statistic) of the target variable for that category.
Why it's used: It helps the model capture the relationship between the categorical feature and the target variable.
Example:
If "Revenue" is the target and "Type" is a categorical column:

Type: [Private, Public, Government]
Revenue: [100, 200, 150, 180, 250, 120]
Calculate the mean revenue for each type:

Private → (100 + 180 + 120) / 3 = 133.33
Public → (200 + 250) / 2 = 225
Government → (150) = 150
Replace "Type" with these values:

Private → 133.33
Public → 225
Government → 150
When to Use:
Works well for linear models and neural networks.
Best for datasets where the target variable’s relationship with the categorical variable is strong.
Caution: Overfitting can happen on small datasets, so use techniques like K-fold target encoding.




Bag of Words (BoW) Encoding
Bag of Words is not frequency encoding or target encoding—it's a text-processing technique used to convert textual data into numerical vectors. Let’s differentiate:

What is BoW?
BoW is used for text data.
It creates a vocabulary of unique words in the dataset and represents each text instance as a vector of word counts.
No relationship with target values or category frequencies—it's purely based on text features.
